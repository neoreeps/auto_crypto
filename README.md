# auto_crypto

Yes, this could all be combined differently, but I like to mix shell and python.

# files

crypto.env - rename from crypto.env.template and fill in - used by shell script to execute what you want
exec_crypto.sh - simple shell script to simplify the deposits and buying
crypto.py - simple wrapper around the wrapper for coinbase pro ... using the cbpro python library
